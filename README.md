Advent of code
==============

My attempts at [AOC](https://adventofcode.com)

The problem is: I usually do these in a rush in the evening, and I don't come
back to think of more optimal solutions, so they tend to be kind of brute
force. Unless that's not possible.

I did up to 15 in Haskell.

I'm starting with Golang as I would like to get better at that for my work
@grafana. However, AOC is my one time a year to use Haskell so I might switch
over. :-)
